October 2021 - Present: AI Engineer, Project lead

**Object detection and classification with generated mesh data using Yolov4 enhancement.**
- Modified Yolov4 model to learn from generated mesh data (Photo capture from 3D model of the object) and able to classification and localization real object.
- Changes model structure to increase accuracy from 81% to 99% while minimize computational cost.

### [株式会社DeepX](https://www.deepx.co.jp/)
April 2021 – September 2021 (6 Months): Field Engineer (contract)

**Automate transformation from camera position to robot position and AI model developer.**
- Using QR code to estimate location of camera position (pixel) and interpolate to robot position (world coordination) with feedback state space matrix.
- Using model predictive control to control robot and learn in simulated environment and applied it to real-world robot.
- Coordinate effort from software and hardware team to create real world robot on operation site.

### [Koike & Yoshimura Laboratory, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan](http://www.cns.pi.titech.ac.jp/kylab/?lang=en)
August 2015 – September 2020 (5 years): Master & Ph.D student

September 2020 – March 2021 (6 Months): Researcher

**Prosthetic hand robot with novel control system.**
- The propose of this project was control angle and stiffness of finger and wrist in the same time.
- Developed Array EMG system to measure deep muscles in forearm. Successfully measure finger muscles which locate deep inside forearm and are relatively small compare to other muscles. Convert technology used in EEG system by place multiple number of monopole sensor on the forearm. First model is AMICA using [EEGLAB](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/AMICA) with correlation coefficient to control each finger separately.

**Human head pose direction estimation.**
- Estimate human head direction using facial landmark and normalize 3D model. The facial landmark was estimated using machine learning on 256x256p then normalize model from ratio of middle eye, nose, mouth was calculated according to general anatomy. Finally head pose direction was estimated by match the 3D model with 15 points of facial landmark (4 eye, 3 nose, 2 cheek, 5 mouth, and 1 chin).

**Finger motion capture.**
- Produced new AI based motion capture using all RGB and deep data. The system able to track every single movement of finger separately using image data and convolutional-pose-machines. The result was test and verify using motion capture (Optitrack) with accuracy of 83%. Current platform is realsense camera with Tensorflow on python and output is compare with conventional system with accuracy of 82%.
